## 1. Product goal and threat model

Build a conservative automated trading platform for a **closed, single-owner
personal Windows desktop**:

**deterministic research → supervised simulated paper → unattended simulated
paper → broker-paper → long paper soak → personal-desktop live-readiness → tiny
restricted live → mature operation → polished GUI.**

Stable constraints:

```text
US stocks / ETFs
long-only
no margin / leverage / options / shorts / crypto
deterministic risk approval
paper-by-default
complete auditability
```

Architecture 102 trusts the owner/Administrator, Windows kernel/boot/SYSTEM, and
physical machine control. The bot still protects against practical ordinary-
process/configuration/credential/state/duplicate-effect/risk-bypass/recovery
failures.

## 2. Current repository and deployment provenance

Integration/product baselines:

```text
integration develop baseline:
bd88ee966bff455f9fc897d6cfdfafdd807f27e2

Architecture-94 P2 product base:
a810122a96b6fc90da25d71eede8da64b7272c98
```

Historical PD4 Architecture-110 source-foundation certification:

```text
commit 248cd8de6a3539aab21d5719d96cb7ff1aa0d14c
tree   5e867f1bfc6d945ad67f6c56be252b534645aeb2
5588 passed, 17 skipped in 1519.25s (0:25:19)
```

The later Architecture-111/112 and D5 capture-warm-up source is accepted at:

```text
branch feature/personal-desktop-paper-runtime
HEAD   8c2af5801cbc8f4df869b832a3b78b1eaa2f8996
TREE   f0591e966463c7e1e66dc00ad76fd895500a076f
```

GitHub read-only verification on September 15, 2026 confirmed the remote branch
still pointed exactly at that HEAD/tree before the D6/D7 branch was created.
Do not alter that armed branch merely to continue development.

The isolated D6/D7 branch was created from exactly that accepted D5 HEAD:

```text
feature/pd4-unattended-decision-publication
base HEAD 8c2af5801cbc8f4df869b832a3b78b1eaa2f8996
base TREE f0591e966463c7e1e66dc00ad76fd895500a076f
```

Docs-only catch-up commits may therefore advance the D6/D7 branch beyond its
base without changing the accepted D5 source/deployment tree.

Development interpreter:

```text
F:\AI\ai-trading-bot\.venv\Scripts\python.exe
```

Production interpreter:

```text
F:\AITradingBot\runtime\python.exe
```

Before every bounded local task:

```text
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
git branch --show-current
git rev-parse HEAD
git show -s --format=%T HEAD
git rev-parse origin/<expected-branch>
git status --short
```

Any unexpected mismatch is a STOP. Do not self-correct with checkout/switch/
reset/rebase/clean.

## 3. Windows pytest and source-checkout rules

Normal pytest collection uses `pyproject.toml`'s `pythonpath = ["src"]`. Do not
persistently export `PYTHONPATH` for ordinary pytest runs.

Controlled pytest on John's Windows development account must use a fresh
external basetemp because the default
`C:\Users\John\AppData\Local\Temp\pytest-of-John` has a known WinError-5 access
condition:

```powershell
$BaseTemp = "F:\AI\temp\pytest\<purpose>-$([guid]::NewGuid().ToString('N'))"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force 'F:\AI\temp\pytest' | Out-Null
& $Python -m pytest ... --basetemp="$BaseTemp" -p no:cacheprovider
```

Do not globally alter `TEMP` or `TMP` to work around that condition.

Source-checkout operator CLIs that must run independently of cwd or ambient
package resolution use a reviewed `scripts/` launcher that explicitly selects
the checkout's `src`. Before an actual Trading-principal host invocation, run an
import/help probe with the production interpreter against that launcher.

## 4. ChatGPT / Codex workflow

ChatGPT/Sol owns architecture, native Windows/security/authority review, exact
GitHub diff review, debugging strategy, test/certification gates,
merge/deployment/production decisions, small tightly scoped project changes,
and next-step planning.

Current routing:

```text
tiny/simple                                  -> ChatGPT direct
known contract + known files/test surface    -> Luna Extra High
discovery-aware/cross-module bounded work    -> Astra
native Windows/security/authority/recovery   -> Sol High
```

Sol Medium is no longer part of the default routing ladder. Model choice never
transfers architecture or acceptance authority. Do not use subagents unless the
user explicitly requests them.

Codex runs focused tests/checks during implementation. Broad/full certification
is normally user-run locally only after ChatGPT reviews the exact source. If a
broad local certification exposes a failure, diagnose/fix only the affected
area and rerun focused verification before asking for the broad suite again.

Exact-file stage only; never `git add .` or `git add -A`. Preserve unrelated
generated/untracked artifacts and historical permission-warning test folders.

No amend/rebase/merge/force-push/PR-metadata/review-thread changes without
explicit approval.

## 5. Standing authorization model

The user has authorized automatically continuing to the next best **safe,
source-only/read-only** scoped checkpoint when the preceding reviewed checkpoint
passes. Stop at protected effect boundaries or genuine architecture ambiguity.

This does **not** automatically authorize:

```text
manual/ad hoc provider calls or retries outside the reviewed D5 boundary
real decision publication
real Paper-v2 receipt-recovery mutation
production namespace provisioning effects
additional Task Scheduler mutation/enabling/manual start
first real unattended Paper-v2 settlement/execution
broker submission
live trading
changing a closed production/recovery/supervised/unattended gate outside an exact reviewed boundary
v1 cleanup/repair/migration
account/group/password changes
LSA policy/right changes
KSP/signing/private-export effects
unrelated project effects
merge/rebase/amend/force-push/PR metadata changes
```

## 6. Production identity and C3 lineage

Historical C3 source:

```text
82ba29ae2c2cc6bb3544077db0ee21868e6d5693
```

Historical manual C3 acceptance:

```text
call #5: FAILED / CONFIRMED
call #6: SUCCEEDED / CONFIRMED / SUCCESS_SELECTED
```

Selected call #6:

```text
selection_id: 36d6fbb3-bdec-57e0-a9cf-78dc2b8f7280

captured_at: 2026-08-29T09:46:43.769105+00:00
```

Architecture 111 later introduced a separate closed-by-default unattended
market-data gate and source-owned zero-argument capture/session derivation. The
first unattended D3/D4 C3 acceptance capture selected session `2026-09-11`:

```text

## 7. Architecture 94 product composition

Accepted product work:

```text
P1 pure strategy history / deterministic strategy plan
1028e60b99c27cef0994f40d6ce381392abfb0f8

P2 read-only selected-C3 snapshot authority
a810122a96b6fc90da25d71eede8da64b7272c98
```

Preserve:

```text
selected verified C3 snapshot
+ explicit deterministic strategy history
+ authoritative paper-account tip
-> deterministic strategy plan
-> planner/proposal
-> deterministic portfolio risk
-> simulated paper execution
-> successor checkpoint + full-lineage verification
-> Architecture-67 durable transition + receipt
```

Architecture 111 adds a two-phase unattended path without replacing the final
Architecture-94 plan format:

```text
selected current C3 close + C3-authoritative history + account predecessor
-> PreparedManualPaperStrategyDecision
-> durable pre-open decision intent (contains no future execution-session open)
-> later current-C1 selected C3 open for intended execution session
-> existing ManualPaperStrategyPlanArtifactBinding
-> existing PD4 / Architecture-67 Paper-v2 authority
```

## 8. Paper-v2 deployment

Fixed production paths:

```text
final authority root: F:\AITradingBot\Paper-v2
A67 operation root:   F:\AITradingBot\Paper-v2\runtime
receipt parent:       F:\AITradingBot\Paper-v2\runtime\paper-operations
unattended invocation namespace:
                      F:\AITradingBot\Paper-v2\runtime\unattended-invocations
Architecture-111 decision namespace concept:
                      F:\AITradingBot\Paper-v2\runtime\unattended-decisions
```

The exact decision namespace path/security/publication contract still must be
frozen by Architecture 113 before production provisioning/publication.

Retained failed v1 state:

```text
F:\AITradingBot\Paper                    ABSENT
F:\AITradingBot\.Paper.provisioning-v1  PRESENT / RETAINED / UNTOUCHED
```

Never rerun the v1 publisher or delete/repair/rename/migrate/reuse the retained
v1 staging tree as incidental cleanup.

Published Paper-v2 account:

```text
paper_account_id:   9415cd7b-bf36-5fba-bd58-a0f99119dc21

```

The historical completion record correctly says that Architecture 110 source
completion alone did **not** authorize operational unattended deployment. Do not
rewrite it to pretend later D5 deployment evidence existed at that time.

## 10. Architecture 111 — unattended daily-cycle authority

Architecture and validation plan:

```text
docs/architecture/111-personal-desktop-unattended-daily-cycle-authority.md
docs/validation/pd4-unattended-daily-cycle-plan.md
```

The frozen unattended cycle is two-phase:

> A strategy decision targeting session `E` must be durably finalized strictly
> before `regular_open(E)`. After `E` is complete, an independently selected C3
> daily snapshot for `E` supplies the verified daily-bar open used to settle
> that already-finalized decision; its verified close becomes the newest
> strategy observation for the following decision.

Important rules:

- scheduler = untrusted wake only; no semantic trading arguments;
- source-owned v1 XNYS regular open = 09:30 America/New_York;
- selected-C3 session-indexed read authority; no filesystem/newest-file/caller
  selection identity;
- production rolling history must be C3-selected and consecutive;
- MA short=3/long=5 requires six consecutive selected C3 sessions before the
  first fully C3-backed unattended decision;
- the pre-open decision contains no execution-session open;
- late wake at/after intended open cannot manufacture the missing decision;
- `MISSED_DECISION_DEADLINE` and `SESSION_GAP` fail closed;
- no automatic multi-session catch-up;
- market-data capture and decision publication use separate effect gates.

## 11. Architecture 112 / D5 — capture-only warm-up

Architecture and validation plan:

```text
docs/architecture/112-personal-desktop-capture-only-warmup-authority.md
docs/validation/pd4-d5-capture-only-warmup-plan.md
```

D5 uses a distinct zero-semantic-argument capture-only launcher. One wake:

```text
requires all eight gates false
-> opens only market-data gate process-locally
-> calls G5 exactly once
-> restores market-data gate in finally
-> requires all eight gates false again
-> calls effects-closed G6 at most once when G5 state is safe
```

G5 exceptions/ambiguous outcomes never trigger a second call in-process or a
blind scheduler retry. D5 never opens the decision-publication or Paper-v2
effect gates.

### D5-A — accepted task qualification

The installed task matched the frozen D2 contract. Accepted predecessor XML:

```text
da851985d9bfb04c65a83cb64b5441a2f7fd50391924a844749e365ee282d6ec
```

### D5-B — accepted action-only task mutation

The reviewed mutation changed only the launcher action to:

```text
-I F:\AI\worktrees\ai-trading-bot-personal-desktop\scripts\run_personal_desktop_unattended_capture_warmup.py
```

The first mutation call failed with a credential authentication error. That was
not treated as retry authority. Read-only reconciliation first proved the exact
D2 task remained registered with the identical predecessor XML hash. Only then
did a credential-aware second attempt proceed under the existing explicit D5-B
authorization.

Accepted post-mutation D5 task XML:

```text
8005373fad791c85776b4a35b662d46e06fec4ea40ac9ebfead9f413715da457
```

### D5-C — first scheduled capture-only wake ACCEPTED

Canonical evidence:

```text
session:                2026-09-14
terminal:               SUCCEEDED
provider disposition:   CONFIRMED

artifact identity SHA:  bfd131801558be6cbbed96b1e176c428b98df4e9c6dcccffb77c74acdc4870ba
account predecessor:    ed4640e5-0630-525d-b916-d50e31e3ba2a
```

Current authoritative strategy history:

```text
2026-09-11
2026-09-14
selected_count = 2/6
G6 = WARMING_UP
G5 post-capture = NO_NEW_COMPLETED_SESSION
```

All eight committed gate constants were false before and after the accepted
wake. The armed task should continue accumulating eligible completed sessions
naturally. Do not manually start it, backfill history, or modify its source/task
contract while this evidence is accumulating.

D5 itself is **not complete** until the required six-session suffix becomes
ready. Expected terminal handoff is `G6 = DECISION_READY`; even then D5 performs
no publication or Paper-v2 settlement.

## 12. Current development checkpoint — Architecture 113 / D6-D7

While D5 capture-only warm-up continues unchanged, use the isolated
`feature/pd4-unattended-decision-publication` branch for source/design work.

The next architecture checkpoint is:

```text
Architecture 113
Personal-Desktop Unattended Decision Publication Authority
```

The matching validation plan should freeze D6/D7 before implementation.

Required design surface:

```text
canonical immutable pre-open decision-intent artifact
deterministic UUID5 decision/publication identity
exact account/predecessor + six-selected-C3 provenance
strict observed-now < regular_open(E) admission
process-local non-serializable one-shot publication permit
fixed unattended-decisions namespace + exact Trading ACL/path identity
read-only ABSENT / FINALIZED_IDENTICAL / STAGING / CONFLICTING / BLOCKED states
exclusive staging + durability + no-clobber finalization + exact readback
identical duplicate convergence without republishing
crash/ambiguous-publication disposition and no cleanup-as-retry
MISSED_DECISION_DEADLINE / SESSION_GAP behavior
future D8/D9 settlement inputs retained without enabling settlement
```

The decision intent must not contain `open(E)` or any later market-data fact.
Publication identity must not depend on wall-clock publication time, path,
scheduler state, UUID4, object identity, or ambient process state.

D6/D7 authority must be narrower than trading authority. It may eventually
finalize one pre-open decision but must remain incapable of:

```text
market-data capture
Paper-v2 execution
receipt recovery
storage provisioning outside its separately reviewed namespace checkpoint
Task Scheduler mutation
broker-paper submission
live trading
```

Architecture/source work does not authorize a real decision publication. When
D5 later reaches `DECISION_READY`, the first publication remains a separately
protected production acceptance effect.

## 13. Roadmap

```text

PD5   broker-paper integration                              NOT STARTED

PD7   personal-desktop live-readiness                       NOT STARTED
PD8   tiny restricted live -> gradual maturity              NOT STARTED
```

Do not move to broker-paper merely because D5 market-data warm-up succeeds.
The critical path is safe unattended data → safe unattended decision → safe
unattended Paper-v2 settlement → operational soak.

## 14. Effect gates and still-protected actions

All eight production gate constants remain committed false:

```text
PERSONAL_DESKTOP_UNATTENDED_MARKET_DATA_CAPTURE_EFFECTS_ENABLED            = False
PERSONAL_DESKTOP_UNATTENDED_DECISION_PUBLICATION_EFFECTS_ENABLED            = False
PERSONAL_DESKTOP_PAPER_V2_PRODUCTION_EFFECTS_ENABLED                       = False
PERSONAL_DESKTOP_PAPER_V2_RECOVERY_EFFECTS_ENABLED                         = False
PERSONAL_DESKTOP_PAPER_V2_SUPERVISED_EXECUTION_EFFECTS_ENABLED             = False
PERSONAL_DESKTOP_PAPER_V2_RECEIPT_RECOVERY_EFFECTS_ENABLED                 = False
PERSONAL_DESKTOP_PAPER_V2_UNATTENDED_EXECUTION_EFFECTS_ENABLED             = False
PERSONAL_DESKTOP_PAPER_V2_UNATTENDED_STORAGE_PROVISIONING_EFFECTS_ENABLED  = False
```

Architecture 112 permits the D5 runtime to open only the **process-local**
market-data gate around exactly one G5 call. That does not authorize ad hoc
manual provider calls or retries.

Still protected/not authorized outside exact reviewed checkpoints:

```text
manual/ad hoc provider effects or retries outside D5
first real D6/D7 decision publication
real Paper-v2 receipt-recovery mutation
decision/storage namespace provisioning effect
additional scheduler mutation/manual start
first real unattended Paper-v2 settlement/execution
broker order submission
live trading
old v1 publisher rerun
v1 staging delete/repair/rename/migration/reuse
Paper-v2 manual mutation outside reviewed effect checkpoints
account/group/password changes
LSA rights/policy changes

merge/rebase/force-push/amend/PR metadata changes without explicit approval
```

   foundation completion, the Architecture-111 daily-cycle plan, and the
   Architecture-112 D5 plan before new implementation.
2. Prove exact worktree/branch/HEAD/tree/origin/clean state before edits or
   operator work. Never self-correct a mismatch.
3. Treat PD1, PD2, PD3, Architecture-110 source foundation, Architecture 111,
   D3/D4, and accepted D5-A/B/C evidence as established predecessors.
4. Preserve the armed D5 branch at accepted source HEAD/tree while its scheduler
   accumulates warm-up sessions. Do not use that worktree for D6/D7 development.
5. Preserve the dedicated non-admin Trading principal, C1/P2 authority, PD2A
   mutex, Architecture-67 durability/idempotency, and PD3 recovery rules.
6. Remember D5 warm-up is currently `2/6` and `WARMING_UP`; there is no authority
   to synthesize missing history from the offline seed.
7. Develop/review Architecture 113 and the D6/D7 validation plan on the isolated
   decision-publication branch before implementation.
8. Use Sol High for Architecture 113 and any implementation changing Windows
   publication security, authority, ordering, crash ambiguity, or effect
   containment. Use Luna/Astra only for bounded work after the contract is
   frozen according to `AGENTS.md`.
9. Stop before any real decision-publication, storage-provisioning, Paper-v2,
   recovery, scheduler, broker, or live effect unless explicitly authorized.
10. Use fresh external `--basetemp` for controlled Windows pytest and keep full
    repository certification for the final meaningful source gate.
11. After each accepted checkpoint, update/review this handoff and
    `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` before treating the checkpoint as closed.
12. Always include the next recommended milestone/step in milestone and
    verification reports.

## 16. Definition of project success

The project is not complete merely when it can place trades. It succeeds when
the platform can research deterministically, acquire trusted data safely, apply
deterministic risk, interact safely with a brokerage, reconcile external
outcomes after failures/restarts, run unattended, fail closed when authority or
state is uncertain, expose durable evidence, operate under strict real-money
controls, recover predictably, remain understandable/stoppable by its operator,
and expose the reviewed system through a polished GUI without giving AI or
presentation code alternate authority paths.
