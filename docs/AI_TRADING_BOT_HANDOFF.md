# AI Trading Bot — Current Handoff

## Current boundary — P6 source correction, no P6 provider attempt

Accepted P5B baseline source:

    HEAD 7ff86d06a99bcdf349d5e20846d139a554d8be46
    TREE 095c51cedc1c656616123c3acf88148b16b71aa2

P5B protected evidence is PASS and read-only: the live Agentic account
resolver, SPY quote, portfolio, position and order schemas worked; position
and order baselines were zero; mutation/review/place/cancel counts were zero;
and production state stayed unchanged. The external P5B report supplies the
account fingerprint at runtime; it is not present in source or docs.

Implementation worktree:
`F:\AI\worktrees\ai-trading-bot-p6-tiny-live-current`.
Branch: `feature/robinhood-p6-tiny-live-current`.
P6 source was accepted and integrated with feature and develop identical at:

    HEAD 5330957b0c7c55d133503a1953ab38f97db31d92
    TREE 8690f9af86000447b08d6c140567796f3403e779

Feature run `41515801379` and develop run `41517145924` succeeded. The earlier
red P6 runs remain immutable; the P6 validation record preserves their chronology.
This is the direct parent of the new source-only consumed-attempt correction.
Its candidate CI/acceptance/integration is pending, not inherited from the parent.
The correction has made no OAuth, provider, broker, order or live-state call.

B1 is accepted/integrated. Feature CI `41366532747` and develop integration
CI `41367640239` succeeded. Real adjusted acquisition and the frozen
filtered-trend campaign are complete. Accepted binding:

B2's first import attempt was a non-consuming STOP. Corrected B2:
IMPORT_SOURCE_AUTHORITY=PASS; OPEN_REPLAY_SMOKE=PASS; first fill BUY 1 SPY at
cursor 51; restart 51 -> 52; fill count 1 -> 1; no duplicate fill; network
attempts 0; FINAL_HOLDOUT accesses 0; final runtime STOPPED. Production P5
SQLite and lifecycle remained absent. Do not repeat the smoke or start a soak.

## Next milestone — P6 correction publication and exact-source review

Registered checkpoint: `arch147-p6-tiny-live`.
Canonical certification: GitHub-owned FULL, broad-1 through broad-7.
Verify/source authority is effect-free; the registered preflight and execute
functions are not run during this implementation checkpoint. The current live
surface is separate from P5B and exposes only explicit reads, review, place and
cancel methods after advertised-schema discovery. It requires dollar orders;
there is no share-quantity fallback, generic public dispatch, option/crypto
surface or GUI placement button.

The P6 policy is SPY-only, accepted FILTERED_TREND_BASE_MA 35/50, long equities
only, maximum $10 per order and $10 gross exposure, one working order, and
regular-hours GFD market orders. Plans are immutable and sanitized; raw account
numbers remain in memory only. Execution is disarmed unless both reviewed
environment interlocks match the exact plan digest. A failed placement is
`MAY_HAVE_OCCURRED` with no retry. The correction retains one attempted place
call through parsing, post-trade reconciliation and lifecycle-write failures;
a marker consumed before placement retains zero place calls and forbids retry.
The first fill disables further buys by default. See
[contract](architecture/147-p6-tiny-live.md) and
[validation](validation/arch147-p6-tiny-live.md).

After this correction reaches terminal feature green, ChatGPT owns exact-source
review and fast-forward integration readiness. A later separately reviewed
operator boundary may run P6 preflight only from accepted integrated source; a
source PASS grants no live authority.
