# AI Trading Bot - Current Handoff

## Current milestone: L43 A3 ACCEPTED / INTEGRATED; A2 METADATA OBSERVATION ACCEPTED; B1 NEXT

Canonical feature worktree: `F:\AI\worktrees\ai-trading-bot-live-prototype-current`; branch: `feature/robinhood-live-prototype-current`.

Accepted/integrated A3 source:

- HEAD: `5b571734222324b98786b150236b1dfd471d8b9d`
- tree: `7c8986d360851ebf07af74e37608f18185dd7d74`
- direct parent: `1d04f7e2213df277fde8200a901f39ba8fd660a6`
- feature mapped FULL: `43411983474`, attempt 1, SUCCESS
- develop integration gate: `43503087853`, attempt 1, SUCCESS
- develop reuse: `DEVELOP_CERTIFICATION_REUSE=True`, reason `exact_feature_certification`
- develop duplicate FULL: NO
- protected/provider effects during A3 source work: `0`

A3 leaves the shared historical preflight dispatcher chain unchanged and registers the existing A2 runtime-partition metadata observer only through the current `arch147-live-prototype` read-only `preflight`. `execute=None` and `remote_head_env=None` remain.

The reviewed A2 metadata observation is now ACCEPTED / CONSUMED SUCCESSFULLY / NO RETRY.

Runner evidence:
`F:\AI\temp\ai-trading-bot-checkpoints\operator-33734b29c3f441ae88abe546e241d91f\arch147-live-prototype\preflight-20261113T205548.135877Z\report.json`

Observer evidence:
`F:\AI\temp\arch147-agent-initiated-runtime-proof-eligible-0d1c18123732442c9d3f4a14ba0f43e6\evidence.json`

Observer evidence SHA-256:
`34483478bbf6430ff0e9a139cd33cdc8837be22eff100e53e0f6b2fdde46c3f1`

Observed result:

- `status=PASS`
- `disposition=SUCCESS_REVIEW_ONLY`
- `observer_status=AUTHENTICATED_RUNTIME_PARTITION_SCHEMA_FOR_REVIEW`
- `observer_reason=AUTHENTICATED_RUNTIME_PARTITION_SCHEMA_FOR_REVIEW_ONLY`
- `source_recheck_status=PASS`
- `IDENTITY_STABLE=True`
- OAuth scope-entry attempts: `1`
- MCP session-open attempts: `1`
- `tools/list` attempts/pages: `1/1`
- browser launches: `0`
- MCP tool invocations: `0`
- account/order/position reads: `0/0/0`
- review/place/cancel: `0/0/0`
- other tool calls: `0`
- `partition_equality_proof=NOT_PROVEN`
- `production_order_scope_authority=NOT_GRANTED`

This closes only the metadata-eligibility question. It does not prove the TRUE/FALSE partitions equal the account-wide order universe. Production remains `ORDER_SCOPE_UNPROVEN`. The earlier `placed_agent` observation remains consumed/no-retry; Q62 remains consumed/immutable; Q63 is NOT RUN; L41R7 is FORBIDDEN; `FINAL_HOLDOUT` remains SEALED.

## Immediate next step

B1 is the next source checkpoint. Propagate a strict boolean `agent_initiated` field through the normalized L43 order model/read adapter needed by the future runtime proof. Accept only real booleans and fail closed on null/missing/string/numeric/ambiguous values. Preserve existing order identity/pagination/reconciliation semantics and do not add production order authority, provider fallback, protected effects, or B2 runtime observation behavior.

After B1 exact-source acceptance/integration, B2 will separately implement and run the four-read runtime proof: ALL-before, TRUE, FALSE, ALL-after, with exhaustive pagination, stable ID universe, strict booleans, duplicate/conflict rejection, exact union/partition equality, source/evidence binding, and no retry after an ambiguous/provider-effectful read sequence.

## L41R1 consumed observation and L41R2 source successor

The consumed predecessor is recorded exactly as
`L41R1_REAL_OBSERVATION=CONSUMED_BLOCKED_NO_RETRY`. Its preserved evidence is
`F:\\AI\\temp\\arch147-l41r1-schema-observation-f5b81e5f60dc40c280f53007d1db2b52\\evidence.json`,
SHA-256
`2b62f54076fdfd34aa3eb799ed563701f8eadafe8877b25590f88fe72147160f`,
length `1130` bytes. It recorded source admission PASS, OAuth scope entry `1`,
MCP session-open `1`, `tools/list=0`, empty schemas, reason
`L41R1_MCP_SESSION_OPEN_FAILED`, and zero MCP tool, account, tradability,
position, order, portfolio, quote, review, placement, cancellation and
other-tool attempts.

The exact cause was `_create_windows_oauth_factory()` installing
`_forbid_interactive_oauth`; the MCP OAuth SDK required an authorization-code
flow and invoked that blocker. The classification is
`L41R1_INTERACTIVE_OAUTH_FORBIDDEN`, not a generic browser/environment failure.
The attempt also exposed an upstream OAuth/MCP traceback-output defect because
provider/OAuth traceback text reached the terminal despite sanitized evidence.

`L41R2_INTERACTIVE_SCHEMA_DISCOVERY` is the separately named additive successor
with evidence schema `arch147-l41r2-interactive-interface-observation/v1`. It
preserves the corrected schema facts, permits one reviewed interactive OAuth
authorization when persisted state is insufficient, suppresses upstream
provider/OAuth output, and invokes only bounded `tools/list`. Evidence records
browser launches as `0` or `1`, native credential read/write counts as `null`,
and `SDK_MANAGED_NOT_INDIVIDUALLY_COUNTED`; raw URLs, callback values, tokens
and provider text are never persisted. A successful result is
`CAPTURED_FOR_REVIEW` only and grants no live readiness, broker authority, Q62
acceptance or order authority. At that historical checkpoint, Q62 remained NOT
RUN and blocked pending L41R3 classification; the current Q62 boundary is
recorded above.

The L41R2 observation is CONSUMED / BLOCKED / NO RETRY. Its immutable evidence
is
`F:\\AI\\temp\\arch147-l41r2-schema-observation-9a504f5e26b9414998cea287ee13936a\\evidence.json`,
SHA-256
`66C3E5C32A0FD575490B3219AEA7DE2ECCEE65C4E5FDEFF6EB339B9B963FA751`, length
`1386` bytes, reason `L41R2_SCHEMA_MALFORMED`. Source HEAD/tree were
`d421562703d6bae92b14afdcc1b3defcc595dbc8` /
`b0ca242360b1cfe17222c4b56e95198219eee4be`; FEATURE and
PROSPECTIVE_DEVELOP admission both passed. It recorded one OAuth scope-entry
attempt, one MCP session-open attempt, one browser launch, and one `tools/list`
attempt. All prohibited MCP tool/account/tradability/position/order/portfolio/
quote/review/place/cancel/other-tool counters were zero. Native credential
read/write fields are `null` with accounting
`SDK_MANAGED_NOT_INDIVIDUALLY_COUNTED`; automatic retry is FORBIDDEN.

The failure is classified from source/client-model comparison: the source
extracts the wire spelling `inputSchema`, while MCP SDK v2 Tool objects expose
the Python attribute `input_schema`. The consumed evidence does not record the
raw provider object type. L41R3 is the additive successor with evidence schema
`arch147-l41r3-mcp-v2-interface-observation/v1`; it normalizes only name,
description, schema and pagination cursor before using the existing fail-closed
sanitized parser. Its success remains `CAPTURED_FOR_REVIEW` only, with zero
tool calls and no Q62, live, broker, order, numeric-rule or `FINAL_HOLDOUT`
authority. At the L41R2 source-acceptance checkpoint, real L41R3 had not yet
run; its later consumed observation is recorded above.

The first unpublished L41R2 prepublication admission is preserved at
`F:\\AI\\temp\\arch147-l41r2-source-admission-2804bb15b8ec49eab4f0ac8ac0fe0a0f` and is classified
`PREPUBLICATION_ADMISSION_TOPOLOGY_DEFECT` / `FULL_LANE_DUPLICATE_BASENAME`.
The enlarged FULL inventory placed `tests/portfolio/test_models.py` and
`tests/rebalancing/test_models.py` together in broad-5, producing the required
`40 != 39` basename invariant failure under the current pytest topology. No
authority failure occurred, `IDENTITY_STABLE=True`, and `PROTECTED_EFFECTS=0`.
This was not a product-source failure, published red source, coverage defect,
or GitHub CI failure. The corrected admission subsequently passed, the amended
candidate was published as
`235118f70b7c7039055e9fea45ccf27df46671a0` / tree
`972004101036afe52642ed93c38fed21ea479956`, mapped FULL
`42358983502` attempt 1 was terminal SUCCESS, and independent exact-source
review accepted the L41R2 implementation. At that source-acceptance checkpoint
the real observation had not yet run; it was subsequently consumed as
BLOCKED / NO RETRY in the L41R2 record above. It does not advance Q62.

## L40 accepted/integrated checkpoint

Canonical worktree: `F:\AI\worktrees\ai-trading-bot-live-prototype-current`;
branch: `feature/robinhood-live-prototype-current`.

Accepted L40 source HEAD:
`14e1b628c0c51c27b23deabee56eb91859818529`

Accepted L40 source tree:
`48b588cbb37818b0d1edfcbb895cfb715a2bf2d3`

Direct parent:
`f7f13f805ad6a0eea7041cb6d13c561149a13f6e`

Feature mapped FULL `41995282653`, attempt 1, was SUCCESS with all seven
canonical broad lanes, active tests, hygiene/evidence and aggregate source gate
green. The exact source was independently accepted. Ordinary fast-forward
integration then moved `develop` to the accepted L40 source; develop gate
`41997418576`, attempt 1, was SUCCESS and reused feature certification
`41995282653` without another FULL. Remote feature and develop were both
verified at the accepted L40 HEAD/tree before this coordination closeout.

The accepted [L40 contract](architecture/147-restricted-live-contract.md) is an
effect-disabled pure policy owner. It freezes exact-owned full-remainder exits,
the <=$10 requested/cumulative new-acquisition budget, reducing exits without a
universal $10 exit-notional ceiling, partial-fill ownership, residual
preservation, exact identity matching and UNKNOWN/MAY_HAVE_OCCURRED no-retry
semantics. Evidence-reference flags are necessary-only prerequisites and
authenticate nothing by themselves. L40 does not establish actual Robinhood
account fractional-sell eligibility, numeric quantity/minimum/notional rules,
durable controller persistence or live-order authority.

The next source step described at L40 was superseded by the current source
preparation milestone above. D33 and D34 remain consumed/no-retry and
`FINAL_HOLDOUT` remains sealed. No paper soak is inserted.

## D34 accepted/integrated closeout identity

Worktree: `F:\AI\worktrees\ai-trading-bot-live-prototype-current`

Branch: `feature/robinhood-live-prototype-current`

Integrated source HEAD: `b86defebf9ccbf1efb91397de8f2e66db24a6665`

Integrated source tree: `9fa2360dfe7afdd902fd539e94f888063439785d`

Feature mapped FULL `41969407894`, attempt 1, and develop source-gate
`41973853073`, attempt 1, both succeeded; develop reused the exact feature
certification. That is the accepted D34 implementation identity; the later
canonical closeout and current L40 base are recorded above. The accepted/integrated
D33 source remains the D34 lineage ancestor
`fad65c9f4eab5bc1de4e154fdf0f59e397bc943a` / tree
`beab205abcc045fad38625ff73bb48affea9a0e9`. The first D34 publication
`9981bf47072d35381a2e5b6f187c9497e9dbed5a` is its direct child, and accepted
D34 corrective source `b86defebf9ccbf1efb91397de8f2e66db24a6665` is the direct
child of `9981bf47072d35381a2e5b6f187c9497e9dbed5a`. D33 is a consumed
predecessor incident, not an available observation boundary.

The preserved D34 predecessor is
`9981bf47072d35381a2e5b6f187c9497e9dbed5a` / tree
`a8d2b4fb4a40039b74768b44fd0198dc87bc55f3`. Its mapped run `41950572892`,
attempt 1, was terminal SUCCESS, but exact-source review rejected it before
develop integration because blocked-result attempt counts were not bound to
their failure phase and the operator fallback could write false `0/0`
credential/provider counts after an escaped failure. No D34 real observation
occurred; the candidate remains immutable evidence.

D30 is ACCEPTED with dataset ID
`d5aa8ed7-b5cd-53a3-8671-5370f976e8e3`, dataset SHA
`ebe1839d510db0f24f58f9ebe02b7efb09221d4b8c06c23122f84912c3225214`, and
`ALPACA_ALL_ADJUSTED_PRICE_V1`. D31's exact bundle is ACCEPTED with campaign
`9b2a000e-3adc-50f4-ab47-2aa90665e3c9`, bundle
`f01a39a7-0a65-55bb-9d38-608b1ce0bd21`, bundle SHA
`94870e0e0e10de16f7e98e7cfea2e2c84458a15e6f1d2665cd8a5dc7e404fc11`, result
`NONE_QUALIFIES`, and retained control `BASE_MA35_50_V1` / candidate
`21158358-75be-5597-b940-5bccdda1429c`. D32 is ACCEPTED / CLOSED: strategy
math parity, research-binding integrity, and live data-basis parity passed;
the 2,516 comparisons had zero mismatches. The former
`DATA_BASIS_MISMATCH` blocker is closed.

## Consumed D33 incident

D33's one real read-only attempt is CONSUMED / BLOCKED / NO RETRY. Preserved
evidence:
`F:\\AI\\temp\\arch147-d33-alpaca-observation-576b4b5c8f7b41548df7b822c44c74de\\evidence.json`;
SHA-256 `b767727712e4634950be8a6ba8f43522910d037987824ad33cb7c20c8eab95ec`,
1,999 bytes; observation `2026-11-04T23:59:08.218729Z`; credentials `1`;
provider requests `1`; selected sessions `60`; production, broker,
runtime-binding, campaign, and FINAL_HOLDOUT mutation counts are all `0`.
The exact provider rejection subtype is unavailable because D33 discarded it.
The request end exceeded observation through end-of-calendar-day semantics;
this is a source-contract defect, not proof of the provider's exact rejection
cause. D33's exact request target is preserved in the validation ledger.

## Accepted D34 observation and stop conditions

The corrective D34 child changes only attempt-accounting/evidence truthfulness
and focused tests/docs. The additive D34 source derives one exact published
regular close after selecting the 60 completed XNYS sessions and before
credential/provider construction. That same cutoff is used for the request and
`CompletedSignalInputs`; it never uses next midnight, end-of-calendar-day,
observation-as-substitute, silent subtraction, provider fallback, or a changed
session set. D34's separately named entry point is
`trading_bot.live_prototype.alpaca_signal_recovery_operator`, with evidence
schema `arch147-d34-alpaca-signal-observation/v1`. The old D33 CLI is retired
before credentials/provider access; `--help` remains effect-free.

D34 source admission and the mapped feature FULL completed before the
separately labeled read-only observation. The accepted evidence is
`F:\\AI\\temp\\arch147-d34-alpaca-observation-84d32fb2af5045e7a661a77259b690fb\\evidence.json`,
2800 bytes, SHA-256
`7c6f2d391cbb3141405e3252efcfcd94db18b8e81083d947d778310bfe49464b`.
Schema: `arch147-d34-alpaca-signal-observation/v1`; status READY; reason
`D34_ALPACA_SIGNAL_INPUTS_READY`; observation timestamp
`2026-11-05T05:28:41.664723Z`.

The observation consumed exactly one credential read and one provider call, with
automatic retry FORBIDDEN. The exact one-request target is
`GET /v2/stocks/bars?symbols=SPY&timeframe=1Day&start=2026-08-12T04%3A00%3A00.000000Z&end=2026-11-04T21%3A00%3A00.000000Z&limit=60&adjustment=all&asof=-&feed=sip&currency=USD&sort=asc`.
It selected 60 sessions from 2026-08-12 through 2026-11-04. Response-body
bytes were 6702 with SHA-256
`296c9e89dd2f48d47b1ca3b071411d6e8509ca769fc92e433be19696bbf68c94`;
provider request-ID digest was
`6384000426f7d007ed9391b81bef6beb2ba40a5193cf94dd30a2a58fb63ae15f`; and
the `CompletedSignalInputs` digest was
`8b6d4f88012da820890cb5070de975c1d02504aeb432939a2e954d9bf9dfecb0`.
No raw request ID or credential material is retained.

The D34 attempt is CONSUMED SUCCESSFULLY / NO RETRY. Production, broker,
runtime-binding, campaign, order, paper, live, and `FINAL_HOLDOUT` effects are
all zero. The observed BASE_MA35_50_V1 BUY/HOLD outputs are signal outputs only;
they do not authorize an order or grant live eligibility.

At the L40 closeout, its original L41-L43 dependency plan was the accepted
baseline and Q61 had not yet run. Q61 was accepted later as recorded in the
current milestone above. No live-readiness label or paper-soak milestone is
granted and `FINAL_HOLDOUT` remains sealed.

The old P6 preflight is historical predecessor context, not the current next
operator action and not the D33/D34 signal-data path. It grants no retry.
