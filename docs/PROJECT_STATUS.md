## Current milestone - Q62 READ-ONLY OBSERVATION ACCEPTED; L43 REVIEW NEXT

The Q62 readiness observer source remains SOURCE/CERTIFICATION ACCEPTED and FAST-FORWARD INTEGRATED at `4633eda723e1d755a642b4fa9e637dccdd68a944` / tree `77df8966ea19c8184d2c5aabfe980ecb51b24159`. Feature mapped FULL run `42993536859` passed (17,101 passed, 9 skipped, 0 failed/errors; slowest lane 185.8 seconds); develop run `42995999577` succeeded with exact feature-certification reuse and no duplicate FULL. The docs-only descendant `38153e015154f0e0f9d77b1ce1cfb62ed1472330` / tree `6e2ac40df6259ac046944fee3d01d946fefde13b` passed feature docs CI `42996562430` and develop docs CI `42996694799`.

The fixed local-only `prepare-state` operation was performed exactly once on that docs descendant, exited 0 and returned `PREPARED / Q62_LOCAL_STATE_PREPARED_CREATE_ONCE`. It created `F:\AI\arch147-q62-live-state-v1` with only the pristine zero-baseline `durable-state.jsonl` (806 bytes; SHA-256 `21F6C07273226D467F85CC8B86DED104B58A94C456E81C67521F94D8CC7CA7D1`). No credentials, provider, network, broker or Q62 observation occurred during preparation. Do not rerun, replace, reset or repair this create-once root.

The separate real Q62 protected read-only observation then exited 0 against exactly `38153e015154f0e0f9d77b1ce1cfb62ed1472330` / `6e2ac40df6259ac046944fee3d01d946fefde13b`. Preserved evidence: `F:\AI\temp\arch147-q62-tiny-live-readiness-ecd813dcb93f4f66bb7f9adce592ed42\evidence.json`, 11,663 bytes, SHA-256 `4D08EB505651CEB551BF6D94BB87960F14940925263D3E682B62610A063FC9C9`. It returned `READY_FOR_L43_PROTOTYPE_READ_ONLY / Q62_READ_ONLY_PREREQUISITES_PROVEN`: all nine source-derived proofs are PROVEN; historical Q62 remains `BLOCKED` with the sole `CAPABILITY_UNPROVEN` blocker; prototype Q62 has no blockers. Attempt accounting reports Robinhood accounts/positions/orders reads 1/1/1 and one Alpaca snapshot/provider call, with zero review/place/cancel/other-tool, broker/live/paper mutations or FINAL_HOLDOUT access. Provider mutation count is 0; live readiness and trade authority remain false. The observation is CONSUMED / NO AUTOMATIC RETRY.

## Immediate next step

Complete this one atomic docs-only Q62 closeout, then independently review the L43 prototype qualification source, current external state/identity continuity and exact protected effect contract. `READY_FOR_L43_PROTOTYPE_READ_ONLY` is a read-only prerequisite result, not an L43 live-readiness label, order-review/place/cancel authority or authorization to enter. L43 requires a distinct reviewed protected boundary; do not derive effect permission from the nine Q62 proofs, reuse consumed Q62 evidence as freshly valid proof in a later session, or manufacture a fresh durable identity. The Q62 state remains bound to `38153e015154f0e0f9d77b1ce1cfb62ed1472330` / `6e2ac40df6259ac046944fee3d01d946fefde13b`; this docs-only descendant must not silently repoint or reinitialize it. Q63 is NOT RUN; L41R7 is FORBIDDEN; FINAL_HOLDOUT remains SEALED. No paper soak is inserted.

## L41R1, L41R2, and L41R3 historical observations

L41R1 is recorded exactly as
`L41R1_REAL_OBSERVATION=CONSUMED_BLOCKED_NO_RETRY`. Its preserved evidence is
`F:\\AI\\temp\\arch147-l41r1-schema-observation-f5b81e5f60dc40c280f53007d1db2b52\\evidence.json`,
SHA-256
`2b62f54076fdfd34aa3eb799ed563701f8eadafe8877b25590f88fe72147160f`,
length `1130` bytes. It recorded source admission PASS, one OAuth scope-entry
attempt, one MCP session-open attempt, zero `tools/list` attempts, empty
schemas, reason `L41R1_MCP_SESSION_OPEN_FAILED`, and zero MCP tool, account,
tradability, position, order, portfolio, quote, review, placement, cancellation
and other-tool attempts.

The exact source-contract cause was
`_create_windows_oauth_factory()` installing `_forbid_interactive_oauth`; the
MCP OAuth SDK required an authorization-code flow and invoked that blocker. The
classification is `L41R1_INTERACTIVE_OAUTH_FORBIDDEN`, not a generic browser or
environment failure. The attempt also exposed an upstream OAuth/MCP traceback
output defect: sanitized evidence did not prevent provider/OAuth traceback text
from reaching the terminal.

`L41R2_INTERACTIVE_SCHEMA_DISCOVERY` is a separately named additive successor
with evidence schema `arch147-l41r2-interactive-interface-observation/v1`. It
retains the corrected schema semantics, permits one reviewed interactive OAuth
authorization when persisted state is insufficient, suppresses upstream
provider/OAuth output, invokes only bounded `tools/list`, and records no raw
URLs, callback values, tokens or provider text. Credential reads and writes are
SDK-managed and individually uncounted (`null`/`null`). A successful result is
`CAPTURED_FOR_REVIEW` only; it grants no live readiness, broker authority, Q62
acceptance or order authority. At that historical checkpoint, Q62 was NOT RUN
and blocked pending L41R3 classification; its current boundary is above.

The L41R2 observation is CONSUMED / BLOCKED / NO RETRY. Its preserved evidence
is
`F:\\AI\\temp\\arch147-l41r2-schema-observation-9a504f5e26b9414998cea287ee13936a\\evidence.json`,
SHA-256
`66C3E5C32A0FD575490B3219AEA7DE2ECCEE65C4E5FDEFF6EB339B9B963FA751`, length
`1386` bytes. It records `L41R2_SCHEMA_MALFORMED`, source HEAD/tree
`d421562703d6bae92b14afdcc1b3defcc595dbc8` /
`b0ca242360b1cfe17222c4b56e95198219eee4be`, and FEATURE plus
PROSPECTIVE_DEVELOP admission PASS. It records one OAuth scope-entry attempt,
one MCP session-open attempt, one browser launch, and one `tools/list` attempt.
MCP tool invocation, account, tradability, positions, orders, portfolio,
quotes, review, placement, cancellation, and other-tool attempt counters are
all zero. Native credential read/write counts are both `null` with accounting
`SDK_MANAGED_NOT_INDIVIDUALLY_COUNTED`; automatic retry is FORBIDDEN.

The source extracts `inputSchema`, while MCP SDK v2 Tool objects expose the
Python attribute `input_schema` and retain `inputSchema` on the wire. The
L41R2 fake object fixture used the older camelCase attribute and did not cover
the SDK object model. This is a source/client-model comparison; the consumed
evidence itself does not identify a raw provider object type.

L41R3 is the separately named additive successor with evidence schema
`arch147-l41r3-mcp-v2-interface-observation/v1`. It normalizes only tool name,
description, input schema, and pagination cursor before passing them through
the existing fail-closed sanitized schema parser. It accepts MCP-v2
`input_schema`, wire/mapping `inputSchema`, and the intentionally retained
legacy object attribute `inputSchema`. It preserves one-shot OAuth/session and
browser limits, bounded `tools/list`, zero tool invocations, output
suppression, truthful SDK-managed credential accounting, and no-retry
semantics. `CAPTURED_FOR_REVIEW` grants no Q62 readiness, broker/order or
numeric-rule authority, live eligibility, or `FINAL_HOLDOUT` authority. At the
L41R2 source-acceptance checkpoint, the L41R3 observation had not yet been run;
its later consumed result is recorded in the current boundary above.

The first unpublished L41R2 prepublication admission is preserved at
`F:\\AI\\temp\\arch147-l41r2-source-admission-2804bb15b8ec49eab4f0ac8ac0fe0a0f` and is classified
`PREPUBLICATION_ADMISSION_TOPOLOGY_DEFECT` / `FULL_LANE_DUPLICATE_BASENAME`.
Adding the interactive L41R2 test enlarged the deterministic FULL inventory and
exposed `tests/portfolio/test_models.py` and
`tests/rebalancing/test_models.py` together in broad-5 under the current
top-level pytest import topology. The required invariant observed `40 != 39`
unique basenames. No authority failure occurred, `IDENTITY_STABLE=True`, and
`PROTECTED_EFFECTS=0`; this was not a product-source failure, published red
source, coverage defect, or GitHub CI failure. That first admission remains a
preserved failure. A later fresh admission passed, and the corrected candidate
was published and independently accepted at
`235118f70b7c7039055e9fea45ccf27df46671a0` / tree
`972004101036afe52642ed93c38fed21ea479956`. Mapped FULL run `42358983502`,
attempt 1, was terminal SUCCESS. The real
`L41R2_INTERACTIVE_SCHEMA_DISCOVERY` was later consumed as BLOCKED / NO RETRY;
see the exact evidence record above. At that source-acceptance checkpoint,
L41R3 was its additive successor and had not yet been run against Robinhood;
the later L41R3 observation is recorded in the current boundary above.

## L40 accepted/integrated baseline

L40 is ACCEPTED / INTEGRATED at
`14e1b628c0c51c27b23deabee56eb91859818529` / tree
`48b588cbb37818b0d1edfcbb895cfb715a2bf2d3`. Feature mapped FULL
`41995282653`, attempt 1, was SUCCESS. Develop gate `41997418576`, attempt 1,
was SUCCESS and reused the exact feature certification without duplicate FULL.

The accepted [L40 contract](architecture/147-restricted-live-contract.md)
freezes effect-disabled exact ownership, nonresetting <=$10 requested
new-acquisition budget, truthful reducing-exit notional/fill semantics,
partial-fill ownership, residual preservation, identity binding and
UNKNOWN/no-retry behavior. It grants no provider/order authority and does not
authenticate caller-supplied evidence references.

At L40 closeout, the remaining path started with the L41 read-only Robinhood
fractional-exit capability observer, followed by durable ownership/budget,
runtime signal, application, readiness/recovery, and live qualification work.
That L40 plan is historical; the current source-preparation state and next step
are recorded above. `FINAL_HOLDOUT` remains sealed.

Accepted/integrated D34 source:
`b86defebf9ccbf1efb91397de8f2e66db24a6665` / tree
`9fa2360dfe7afdd902fd539e94f888063439785d`. Feature mapped FULL
`41969407894`, attempt 1, and develop source-gate `41973853073`, attempt 1,
succeeded; develop reused the exact feature certification. D34's accepted
source descends from the integrated D33 source
`fad65c9f4eab5bc1de4e154fdf0f59e397bc943a` / tree
`beab205abcc045fad38625ff73bb48affea9a0e9` through the preserved first D34
publication `9981bf47072d35381a2e5b6f187c9497e9dbed5a`.

D30 is ACCEPTED with dataset semantic ID
`d5aa8ed7-b5cd-53a3-8671-5370f976e8e3`, dataset SHA-256
`ebe1839d510db0f24f58f9ebe02b7efb09221d4b8c06c23122f84912c3225214`, and
price basis `ALPACA_ALL_ADJUSTED_PRICE_V1`.

D31's exact research bundle is ACCEPTED: campaign
`9b2a000e-3adc-50f4-ab47-2aa90665e3c9`, bundle
`f01a39a7-0a65-55bb-9d38-608b1ce0bd21`, bundle SHA-256
`94870e0e0e10de16f7e98e7cfea2e2c84458a15e6f1d2665cd8a5dc7e404fc11`, and
selection `NONE_QUALIFIES`. The retained control is `BASE_MA35_50_V1` with
candidate ID `21158358-75be-5597-b940-5bccdda1429c`. NONE_QUALIFIES means that
neither challenger qualified; it is not a winning challenger, promotion,
profitability proof, or live eligibility.

D32 is ACCEPTED / CLOSED: strategy math parity, research-binding integrity, and
live data-basis parity all passed; the 2,516 strategy comparisons had zero
mismatches, and the accepted D34 observation used the same
`ALPACA_ALL_ADJUSTED_PRICE_V1` basis as D30/D31. The former
`DATA_BASIS_MISMATCH` blocker is closed. Alpaca all-adjusted SIP/USD signal data
and Robinhood broker/account/execution/custody remain separate providers with
no fallback.

D33's real read-only attempt is CONSUMED / BLOCKED / NO RETRY. Preserved
evidence: `F:\\AI\\temp\\arch147-d33-alpaca-observation-576b4b5c8f7b41548df7b822c44c74de\\evidence.json`,
SHA-256 `b767727712e4634950be8a6ba8f43522910d037987824ad33cb7c20c8eab95ec`,
1,999 bytes; observation `2026-11-04T23:59:08.218729Z`; credentials `1`;
provider requests `1`; selected sessions `60`; all prohibited-effect counters
are zero. D33 discarded the safe failure subtype, so the exact provider
rejection subtype is unavailable. Its request end exceeded observation through
end-of-calendar-day semantics; that is a source defect, not a proven provider
rejection cause.

The first D34 publication is preserved at
`9981bf47072d35381a2e5b6f187c9497e9dbed5a` / tree
`a8d2b4fb4a40039b74768b44fd0198dc87bc55f3`; mapped run `41950572892`, attempt
1, was terminal SUCCESS, but exact-source review rejected it before develop
integration. The review found incomplete blocked-result attempt-count
invariants and an operator-level escaped-failure fallback that could fabricate
zero credential/provider counts. No D34 real provider observation occurred.

D34 is now ACCEPTED, INTEGRATED, and CONSUMED SUCCESSFULLY. The accepted
read-only observation is recorded at
`F:\\AI\\temp\\arch147-d34-alpaca-observation-84d32fb2af5045e7a661a77259b690fb\\evidence.json`,
2800 bytes, SHA-256
`7c6f2d391cbb3141405e3252efcfcd94db18b8e81083d947d778310bfe49464b`,
observation timestamp `2026-11-05T05:28:41.664723Z`. It consumed exactly one
credential read and one provider call, with no retry. The one SPY daily request
ended at the exact published XNYS regular close
`2026-11-04T21:00:00.000000Z`; response-body SHA-256 is
`296c9e89dd2f48d47b1ca3b071411d6e8509ca769fc92e433be19696bbf68c94`, and the
`CompletedSignalInputs` digest is
`8b6d4f88012da820890cb5070de975c1d02504aeb432939a2e954d9bf9dfecb0`.
Production, broker, runtime-binding, campaign, paper, live, and
`FINAL_HOLDOUT` counters remained zero. The observation validates the signal
input basis only; it does not authorize an order or grant live eligibility.

## Product and protected boundaries

The product remains a private single-user Windows desktop application with
explicit Start/Stop and manual stopped-state updates. Credentials and durable
state remain outside disposable source files. Live trading is disabled; no real
order is authorized. Readiness labels are not granted by source publication,
source admission, or provider-data parity alone.

Historical P6, P5A/P5B, and earlier architecture evidence remains available in
its owning documents. The current handoff and Architecture 147 validation
ledger record the bounded continuation identity and acceptance state.
