# Architecture 133 — Single-Session Unattended Review-Paper Validation Plan

Status: frozen design plan. No provider access, scheduler mutation, activation
publication, paper mutation, or broker/live effect is authorized by this plan.

Baseline:

```text
develop HEAD 1419b551230b00102291cd3bab2f23e4e1a3588b
develop TREE 5d98221b3a2933726b56692c5092d715455807f4
Architecture 131 merged via PR #24
post-merge source gate #222 SUCCESS
```

## Goal

Prove that one pre-authorized proposal can cross one unattended Robinhood
review-only/synthetic-paper wake without human mid-wake input while retaining
Architecture-131 session, risk, quote-freshness, exactly-once, ambiguity,
evidence, and zero-real-order guarantees.

The first qualification targets exactly one NYSE session. Multi-session
recurrence is deferred.

## 133-A focused validation — ACCEPTED

Accepted exact source:

```text
HEAD b0751e1ff2109b7f99725910ee901685e293e175
TREE 2230e11bcb3a2b27171aaa506f12110c31ae77a0
CI   #227 / 37388706716 SUCCESS
```

The exact six-file GitHub review found no correction requirement. The complete
133-A module is AST-pinned by the source gate, the checkpoint is source-only
with no preflight/execute callback, and #227 passed the optimized batch,
Ruff check/format, diff check, identity-stability check, and 133-A authority
check.

Accepted validation covers:

- strict closed schemas and canonical serialization;
- deterministic activation/wake identities;
- exact proposal/order/session binding;
- filesystem path retained as exact storage material but excluded from
  deterministic identity under the repository-wide identity rule;
- legal and illegal state transitions;
- completed/stopped/indeterminate terminal replay with no transition authority;
- review-started failure -> INDETERMINATE only;
- timezone normalization and malformed timestamp rejection;
- ambient-Decimal-context independence;
- no UUID4, filesystem, SQLite, network/provider/OAuth, risk, scheduler,
  retry/polling, or paper-write capability in the pure module.

Focused implementation verification reported 233 core cases, 1,018 runner
cases, and two certification-inventory cases across the focused and
corrected-failure runs. No broad suite was required at this pure source boundary.

## 133-B focused validation — ACCEPTED

Accepted exact source:

```text
HEAD e27ce1c2cebf38654404a96c06275e892909b2f5
TREE 37781465d0385aaa1251349ebb21fa5af59357c0
CI   #229 / 37392099387 SUCCESS
```

The exact eight-file GitHub review found no correction requirement. 133-B's
three source modules are AST-pinned by the source gate, the checkpoint is
source-only with no preflight/execute callback, and #229 passed the optimized
batch, Ruff check/format, diff check, identity-stability check, and both 133-A
and 133-B authority checks.

Accepted validation covers:

- exact closed SQLite schema/application/user versions;
- atomic activation + READY-wake creation;
- exact-identical read-only reopen and changed-material conflict;
- one-shot optimistic compare-and-swap with monotonic revision;
- transaction rollback and zero busy retry;
- delegation to the accepted 133-A transition matrix;
- terminal/INDETERMINATE persistence across restart;
- deterministic complete-state fingerprinting with explicit sorting;
- independent URI-`mode=ro` verifier that never constructs the writer;
- malformed/partial/duplicate/noncanonical/binding-conflict rejection;
- inert Architecture-131 paper-store material on admitted/verified paths;
- no provider/OAuth/risk/review/paper-fill/scheduler/subprocess/environment/
  clock/retry/polling authority.

Focused implementation verification reported 107 store/verifier, 233
activation-core, 1,067 runner, and 450 inventory cases across focused and
corrected-failure runs. No broad certification was required at this local state
boundary.

## 133-C focused validation — ACCEPTED

Accepted exact source:

```text
HEAD 3f5a5b673bc9d66409e415152d6252cd80a46e3a
TREE 7b048cedea8a97501198311229b25ab32f112735
CI   #231 / 37410294723 SUCCESS
```

The exact six-file GitHub review found no correction requirement. The complete
133-C coordinator is AST-pinned by the source gate, the checkpoint is
source-only with no preflight/execute callback, and #231 passed the 35-checkpoint
optimized batch, 60 test paths, 96 Ruff paths, Ruff check/format, diff check,
identity-stability check, and the 133-A/133-B/133-C authority checks.

Accepted validation covers:

- exact 131-S target-session resolution and 131-M admission;
- READY -> PREPARE_STARTED durable before one quote seam call maximum;
- exact 131-N snapshot and 131-O/K preview/risk material;
- earliest source-mark deadline with no freshness extension/reacquisition;
- PREPARED durable before final predecessor/risk/session revalidation;
- rejection/staleness/session mismatch/material drift -> STOPPED with zero
  review-effect attempts;
- REVIEW_STARTED durable before the fake effect sees control;
- one fake review/paper-effect invocation maximum;
- exact successful acknowledgement -> COMPLETED once;
- post-effect exception/ambiguity -> INDETERMINATE;
- terminal replay zero quote/effect calls;
- PREPARE_STARTED/PREPARED/REVIEW_STARTED reopen reconciliation-only with zero
  new edge calls;
- no historical catch-up, retry, polling, sleep, scheduler, real Robinhood MCP,
  Architecture-131 paper operator/pipeline, or mutation-tool reachability;
- sanitized durability failure behavior with no compensation authority.

Focused implementation verification reported 2,084 distinct cases: 87
composition, 340 overlapping 133-A/133-B, 1,545 runner/inventory, and 112
accepted 131-Q cases. Current inventory is FULL 119, ROBINHOOD 46, LEGACY 204,
EXHAUSTIVE 323. Broad certification remains deferred because 133-C is fake-only.

## 133-D focused validation — FROZEN

133-D source tests must bind the accepted 133-C coordinator to the accepted real
Robinhood quote/review-paper composition while replacing the actual provider
transport/effect with deterministic fakes. They must prove:

- exact accepted 133-C state/edge ordering is reused rather than reimplemented;
- persisted-OAuth-only composition and interactive/browser OAuth rejection;
- accepted 131-P/131-N quote material with one quote request maximum;
- BUY and SELL proposal coverage;
- APPROVED, RESIZED, and REJECTED risk outcomes;
- exact revalidated risk decision/order identity preserved into the accepted
  131-I/H/J/L review-paper path;
- durable REVIEW_STARTED exists before any review-paper operator invocation;
- one Robinhood review attempt maximum;
- accepted operator PASS can acknowledge exactly one deterministic synthetic
  paper result;
- operator FAIL, malformed evidence, provider/transport exception after
  invocation, and process-boundary ambiguity cannot report success and become
  INDETERMINATE;
- provider failure before review invocation becomes STOPPED with zero review
  attempts;
- exact deterministic paper idempotency/replay and no duplicate local fill;
- terminal/review-start replay performs zero new quote/review calls;
- no quote reacquisition, fallback session, historical catch-up, polling, sleep,
  or retry;
- placement, cancellation, options-mutation, and crypto-mutation counters remain
  exactly zero;
- source tests perform no real provider/OAuth/scheduler/broker effect;
- existing accepted Architecture-131 qualification/verifier semantics remain
  regression coverage and 131-V human-supervised behavior is unchanged.

Register
`arch133-robinhood-unattended-review-paper-execution` immediately after 133-C
with
`remote_branch=feature/robinhood-unattended-review-paper-133d`,
`preflight=None`, and `execute=None`.

After focused/source-gate acceptance, run ROBINHOOD certification for the exact
accepted 133-D tree. FULL remains deferred to 133-F.

## 133-E focused validation

Launcher/scheduler-source tests must prove:

- zero semantic CLI arguments;
- no browser/interactive OAuth path;
- exact source/runtime/activation admission before provider access;
- scheduler spec points only at the reviewed launcher;
- no task retries;
- no overlapping effect authority;
- task identity is distinct from historical D10;
- task state is not activation authority;
- source tests never mutate Task Scheduler.

## Certification topology

Use the Architecture 132 policy:

```text
FOCUSED
-> source-gate CI for each pushed registered checkpoint
-> ROBINHOOD at the first coherent complete Robinhood boundary
-> FULL at final Architecture-133 current-product integration
-> LEGACY/EXHAUSTIVE only if a later change actually touches historical compatibility
-> PROTECTED always separately authorized
```

## Protected qualification gates

### Q133-1 — provider-free host preflight

Read-only. Verify exact accepted source/runtime identity, persisted OAuth
availability without browser interaction, paper-store predecessor state,
single-session activation material, proposed scheduler spec, and zero consumed
wake state.

### Q133-2 — activation publication

Fresh explicit approval. Publish exactly one reviewed single-session activation.
No provider request and no scheduler mutation.

### Q133-3 — scheduler installation/update

Fresh explicit approval. Create/update exactly the distinct Architecture-133
one-session task and verify by readback. No manual provider/trading invocation.

### Q133-4 — first unattended wake

Fresh explicit approval to allow the installed one-session task to perform its
single bounded provider wake. The wake may use the accepted read/review tools and
write one synthetic local paper result only. No placement/cancel/options/crypto.

### Q133-5 — provider-free reconciliation

Read-only. Reconcile activation/wake state, operator evidence, paper BEFORE/AFTER
fingerprints, call counts, and zero mutation counters. No retry.

### Q133-6 — task/activation closeout

Prove the single-session authority cannot fire again before deciding on any
multi-session extension.

## Stop conditions

STOP rather than retry on:

- source/runtime/activation mismatch;
- noncanonical or conflicting wake state;
- missed/expired target session;
- quote/session freshness failure;
- risk rejection or risk drift;
- interactive OAuth requirement;
- provider ambiguity;
- any attributable real order;
- any forbidden mutation call;
- durable paper conflict;
- independent verifier disagreement;
- unexpected scheduler identity;
- any already-consumed review-start state.

A STOP/INDETERMINATE result grants no next attempt.

## Exit

A successful Q133-1 through Q133-6 sequence establishes only that one unattended
single-session review-paper wake is safe under the frozen authority. It does not
authorize a multi-session soak, broker-paper, or live trading.
