# Architecture 134 — Production strategy and AI-research validation plan

## 2026-10-11 — Architecture 134-C CERTIFIED/CLOSED

Architecture **134-C — Human-started production live-paper cycle** is
**CERTIFIED/CLOSED** at this exact source-certification boundary:

### Preserved failed FULL and bounded source correction

The first FULL attempt on prior source
`144a66928d9f3fb3d7ff5396059c998839e17a99` /
`04f7ade45d5fdf1e4e6969db8a9b1db5484fa8b2` found 22 stale historical
test-topology assertions after the active inventory grew to 60 checkpoints.
Its failed evidence is preserved and must not be overwritten or reused:

F:\AI\temp\certification\arch134c-full-e210ffcf373748d593a2df83f7b39512
~~~

The bounded test-only correction:

- replaced fragile end-relative checkpoint slices with named/local adjacency;
- removed historical tests' unowned repository-wide eventual-count assumptions;
- confined generic registration mutations to their intended `CheckpointSpec`;
- preserved the dedicated canonical full-topology expectation;
- preserved production behavior, authority, registration, workflow and source
  pins.

The separately approved publication-recovery test expectation proves that only
the historical whole-registry pin differs after later registrations and that
the unchanged protected authority rejects that drift exactly. It does not
refresh a pin or reopen historical recovery authority.

Source gate [#471](https://github.com/callmedraken/ai-trading-bot/actions/runs/38133206242)
is terminal green:

| Job | Conclusion |
| --- | --- |
| source-static | SUCCESS |
| active-tests | SUCCESS |
| full-tests | SKIPPED, correct active-branch behavior |
| source-gates | SUCCESS |

### Final cheap gates before FULL

Exact source/FULL topology plan, `git diff --check`, Ruff check and Ruff
format check all passed before the expensive suite. Ruff format check reported
919 files already formatted. The plan evidence is:

~~~

No separate ROBINHOOD run was required: ROBINHOOD is a strict subset of FULL,
and this selected FULL certification satisfies the narrower source-certification
obligation on the same source. No LEGACY/EXHAUSTIVE run was required. No
provider/OAuth/paper/scheduler/broker/protected effect occurred.

Current exact inventories are active **60**, FULL **161**, ROBINHOOD **86**,
LEGACY **205**, EXHAUSTIVE **366**. The executable/test source is unchanged by
this six-file docs-only closeout. **Do not rerun FULL on that unchanged source.**

### Immediate next boundary: separately authorized SHADOW PREPARE

The next step is a **human-started 134-C SHADOW PREPARE**, using the already
accepted Architecture-131 provider-read path. It requires fresh explicit
authorization because a trade proposal performs real Robinhood/provider/OAuth
read activity. No effectful command is ordinary verification, and this closeout
stops at that protected authorization boundary.

PREPARE is shadow/live-data preview only; it performs no paper fill.
`NO_SIGNAL` has zero provider/paper effects. **`READY_TO_PROCEED` is evidence,
not execution authorization.** Only after a separately authorized PREPARE
returns and ChatGPT reviews its evidence may a separate paper EXECUTE
authorization be considered if the retained result is `READY_TO_PROCEED` and
Architecture-131 revalidation still passes. Real broker placement remains
impossible. 134-C certification does not authorize 134-D scheduling/arming;
134-D remains later.

### Docs-only closeout and repository rules

This atomic checkpoint changes exactly the six approved `docs/**` files and
uses the existing docs-only classifier's cheap validation path. It changes no
Python, tests, scripts, workflow YAML, checkpoint registration or runtime
behavior and manufactures no test rerun.

`AGENTS.md` was reviewed and remains compatible: it already forbids repeated
expensive full-suite runs and delegates detailed certification behavior to
Architecture 132 and the workflow document. It remains unchanged because it is
outside `docs/**`. A future naturally necessary non-docs workflow checkpoint
may mirror the detailed wording there without creating a standalone duplicate-
test event.

## 2026-10-11 — Architecture 134-B SOURCE ACCEPTED

Architecture **134-B — Production Strategy Decision Bridge** is source accepted.

~~~text
BRANCH  feature/robinhood-production-strategy-decision
HEAD    695fa6195b2d8cc1437ba87f5d48c527afa28da7
TREE    00871d80bc9ae0a3f60906d23c92b30e42c670c4
CI      #465 / 38128865894 SUCCESS
~~~

The accepted bridge consumes the exact 134-A production contract plus the
existing Architecture-94 verified strategy-decision request/calendar boundary.
It checks contract config and verified seed symbol/config before the builder,
invokes `build_manual_paper_strategy_decision(...)` exactly once, then requires
the prepared config/symbol/intended session to remain inside the production
contract.

Closed outcomes are exactly `NO_SIGNAL` or `TRADE_PROPOSAL`; a proposal is the
exact Architecture-94 proposal object by identity, not a newly generated or
research-selected proposal.

Source gate #465 passed static diff/Ruff/format/authority, focused pytest, stable
identity and terminal source-gates. The earlier #462/#464 failures were
mechanical Ruff formatting only and are superseded.

Current exact inventories are active **59**, FULL **160**, ROBINHOOD **85**,
LEGACY **205**, EXHAUSTIVE **365**. Broad certification remains deferred until
the first coherent live-paper integration boundary.

134-B owns no Robinhood/provider/OAuth, paper-store mutation, risk execution,
scheduler, clock/sleep, research/AI promotion or broker placement authority.

Next milestone is **134-C — Human-started production live-paper cycle**.
`PREPARE` will serve as the shadow/live-data preview: for a `TRADE_PROPOSAL`,
reuse the accepted Architecture-131 supervised PREPARE path to obtain one live
Robinhood quote, session admission and deterministic risk preview with no paper
mutation. `NO_SIGNAL` performs no provider call. A separate explicit EXECUTE
may then reuse the accepted Architecture-131 review-paper execution path to
record one synthetic local paper fill; real broker placement remains impossible.

## 134-A verification scope

Implementation is source-only and uses fake/pure values. No real host/provider/
scheduler/paper effect is part of this checkpoint.

Focused tests must prove:

- exact schema, strategy ID/version and one-symbol shape;
- valid/invalid source HEAD/TREE formatting;
- exact target-session `date` type; booleans/strings/subclasses are rejected as
  appropriate rather than coerced;
- reuse of the existing `MovingAverageCrossoverConfig` validation;
- canonical finite positive desired quantity serialization including exponent/
  trailing-zero normalization rules chosen by the source contract;
- deterministic contract ID stability and sensitivity to every semantic field;
- different serialized formatting/path/hash cannot redefine semantic identity;
- strict canonical JSON round-trip with exact fields and duplicate/unknown/
  missing field rejection;
- canonical parser rejects noncanonical decimal/date/UUID/strategy spellings;
- strategy-construction helper returns exactly
  `MovingAverageCrossoverStrategy` with the same exact config;
- no evaluation occurs while constructing/parsing/replaying the contract;
- source module import closure excludes provider/MCP/OAuth, SQLite/paper store,
  scheduler, runtime native code, AI/model/research/optimization and execution;
- AST/capability checks reject file/network/subprocess/environment/dynamic-import/
  sleep/clock/effect calls;
- no promotion/candidate-selection API is exposed;
- checkpoint registration has `preflight=None`, `execute=None`; branch route is
  exact and unique;
- audited split/sharded source-gate topology remains reviewed.

Expected implementation files:

~~~text
src/trading_bot/strategies/production.py
tests/strategies/test_production_strategy_contract.py
scripts/checkpoint_runner.py
.github/workflows/checkpoint-source-gates.yml
~~~

Existing exact inventory/count assertions made stale by this one legitimate
module/checkpoint addition must be updated without weakening equality/order/
partition checks. Expected totals after 134-A:

~~~text
active checkpoints  58
FULL               159
ROBINHOOD            85
LEGACY              205
EXHAUSTIVE          364
~~~

Run only focused affected tests plus non-mutating Ruff check/format and
`git diff --check`. Do not run broad certification during implementation.

## Acceptance boundary

Source acceptance of 134-A authorizes only later design/implementation of
134-B. It does not authorize a market-data read, live PREPARE, paper mutation,
arming, waiting, scheduler change, unattended wake, candidate promotion or
broker effect.

## Later validation ladder

134-B: deterministic provider-free strategy decision replay.

134-C: shadow qualification first; then one separately authorized live-data
review-paper qualification with independent durable reconciliation.

134-D: time/session-state tests plus protected scheduler/startup qualification;
hard-coded local market-open time is forbidden because DST/session exceptions
must come from published exchange-session authority.

134-E: exactly one unattended integration session and independent reconciliation.

134-F: fresh multi-session live-paper soak with end-of-window review.

Research lane: historical/backtest/walk-forward tests plus explicit proof that
candidate writes cannot reach production selection, paper account, scheduler or
provider execution surfaces.


## 134-C validation contract

Focused source tests must prove:

- exact 134-B decision type required;
- `NO_SIGNAL` returns without invoking Architecture-131 PREPARE or touching
  store/adapter/risk surfaces;
- target-session mismatch blocks before PREPARE;
- TRADE_PROPOSAL retains and forwards the exact proposal by identity;
- Architecture-131 PREPARE is invoked exactly once;
- every existing supervised preparation status maps exactly to the closed 134-C
  status without inventing execution authority;
- wrapper retains the exact supervised preparation by identity;
- execute rejects anything except exact `READY_TO_PROCEED`;
- expected HEAD/TREE must exactly equal the production contract's source
  HEAD/TREE before Architecture-131 EXECUTE is called;
- Architecture-131 EXECUTE is invoked exactly once and its exact result is
  retained;
- no retry/reacquisition loop or alternate provider/paper implementation;
- no broker placement/cancel/options/crypto capability;
- no scheduler/arming/wait/sleep or AI/research promotion capability;
- checkpoint registration is source-only and exact branch routing preserves the
  audited split/sharded workflow;
- exact inventories become active 60 / FULL 161 / ROBINHOOD 86 / LEGACY 205 /
  EXHAUSTIVE 366.

Run focused tests, non-mutating Ruff check/format and diff check only. Do not
perform a real provider PREPARE, OAuth interaction, paper mutation or broad
certification during implementation.

After exact GitHub source acceptance, the first real 134-C qualification is a
separately authorized human-started **shadow PREPARE**. A paper EXECUTE is a
second separately authorized step and is permitted only if the retained PREPARE
remains `READY_TO_PROCEED` and all Architecture-131 revalidation passes.

## 134-B validation contract

Focused tests must prove:

- exact 134-A contract type required;
- exact Architecture-94 request type and calendar boundary required;
- contract/request strategy-config mismatch blocks before the Architecture-94
  builder is called;
- contract/history-seed symbol mismatch blocks before the builder is called;
- Architecture-94 builder is invoked exactly once on success;
- returned prepared object is retained by identity, never serialized/rebuilt;
- intended execution session must equal the production contract target date;
- prepared config/symbol drift blocks;
- `NO_SIGNAL` returns no proposal;
- `TRADE_PROPOSAL` returns the exact prepared proposal object by identity;
- malformed/inconsistent builder results fail closed;
- no second strategy evaluation is introduced in the bridge;
- import/call surface excludes provider/OAuth/network, paper/SQLite, risk,
  execution/review/order, scheduler/clock/sleep, filesystem/Git/environment,
  runtime/native and research/AI/optimization capabilities;
- no candidate/promotion API;
- checkpoint registration is exactly source-only with the exact 134-B branch;
- active route is unique and audited split/sharded source-gate topology remains
  reviewed;
- all exact inventory expectations are updated to active 59 / FULL 160 /
  ROBINHOOD 85 / LEGACY 205 / EXHAUSTIVE 365 without weakening invariants.

Expected primary implementation surfaces:

~~~text
src/trading_bot/strategies/production_decision.py
tests/strategies/test_production_strategy_decision.py
scripts/checkpoint_runner.py
.github/workflows/checkpoint-source-gates.yml
~~~

Use focused tests plus non-mutating Ruff check/format and diff check. Do not run
FULL/ROBINHOOD/LEGACY/EXHAUSTIVE during implementation.

134-B source acceptance does not authorize 134-C live shadow/provider access or
paper mutation.


## 2026-10-11 — 134-B2 corrective validation checkpoint

Before the first real 134-C SHADOW PREPARE, add and source-accept a
current-product decision materializer.

Focused validation must prove:

- exact 134-A contract is required;
- current verified snapshot/history symbol/config/session match the contract;
- current synthetic-paper prior derives from `ReviewPaperStore` evidence, not
  Paper-v2;
- no code path constructs or forges Architecture-94's protected
  `VerifiedPriorCheckpoint` from ReviewPaperStore;
- the pure Architecture-94 strategy-decision core is shared by the legacy and
  current-product adapters;
- the existing Architecture-94 entry point retains its exact behavior and
  authority validation;
- the Robinhood adapter calls the shared pure decision core exactly once and
  returns through the accepted 134-B closed decision contract;
- exactly one strategy evaluation occurs; no second proposal synthesis exists;
- no D10/Windows/C1/C3/Paper-v2/personal-desktop unattended imports or calls;
- no Robinhood/OAuth/provider/network effect in the materializer;
- no scheduler, broker, live-order, research-promotion or filesystem-repair
  authority;
- missing/insufficient current history fails closed instead of inventing bars;
- source-gate/profile inventory changes remain exact.

Do not repair the observed legacy Paper-v2 root ACL as part of 134-B2. That
diagnostic is preserved only to explain why the legacy observability route was
abandoned.

After exact GitHub review and terminal-green source-gate CI, select only the
smallest distinct certification required by the changed current-product
surface. Do not rerun FULL merely for confidence.
